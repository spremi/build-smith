# build-smith

I have leveraged Jenkins (and earlier Hudson) for many years.

This project is my attempt to create a simple build infrastructure using
**Angular 7** and **NodeJS**. Some inspirations from Jenkins will be quite
obvious. But, hope to be equally different as well.

## Contents

The project shall, eventually, contain 4 sub directories:
* icons

  Custom icons used in the projects.

* server

  An ExpressJS application that implements the application *back-end*.

* client

  An Angular Material application that implements *front-end*.

* bundle

  Scripts to build and create an installable bundle.
